/**
 * This is a handler for extra Animation behavior on Skeleton Models.
 *	When a bone has ended his compute, if it has an attached AnimCtrl, it calls its ::execute() code
 *	The AnimCtrl may modify all or part of the skeleton, knowing that the sons of the bone animCtrled are still not
 *	computed.
 *	Typically, animCtrls should modify the matrix parts of the bone, and then call bone->compute(..,..,NULL)
 *
 *	Note: for convenience, when execute() is called on a bone, the LocalSkeletonMatrix and WorldMatrix 
 *		of this bone are already computed.
 *
 *	Important Note about Bone Loding: 
 *		- AnimCtrl are not called if the bone is loded (ie not animated/computed)
 *		- AnimCtrl is called BEFORE Bone Lod interpolation, resulting in the excepted behavior.
 *
 *	Note about UserInterface logic: CSkeletonModel and CBone appears here but are used only for the derivers of this
 *		class (that are still in 3D), so the UserInterface don't need and don't use it.
 *		Therefore, there is no way (for now) with the strict UserInterface scheme to implements new AnimCtrls. 
 *		But the user is allowed to use the Layer2 (ie CScene, CSkeletonModel etc classes) to create its own AnimCtrls.
