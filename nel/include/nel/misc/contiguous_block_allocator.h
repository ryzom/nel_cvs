/** One of the simplest scheme of allocation around, but very useful in some situations.
  * This allocator is just provided with a single block of memory at start (possibly of size 0). Each alloc get a new block in that big block, by
  * simply advancing a pointer. When not enough space is available, the default stl allocator is used.
  * When a block is deallocated, nothing happens, unless the block was allocated using the default stl allocator is used, in which case deallocate() is called.
  *
  * The typical use is when an object makes a lot of allocations at init, but in a predictable way, and if it don't make alloc / realloc
  * later. In this case the caller can measure the amount of memory needed to create the object, and can create this allocator with the good amount of
  * memory. Subsequent allocations will then be very fast even for very differently sized blocks, with no fragmentation inside the allocated block
  * and no memory overhead per allocated bloc.
  *
  * Obviously, if the quantity of memory to be allocated can't be predicted (or if no max bytes can be forseen), then other allocators may
  * be best suited.
