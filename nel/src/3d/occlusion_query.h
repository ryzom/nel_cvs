/** Interface to an occlusion query object. 
  * An occlusion query allows to know wether some pixels passed the z-test for a set of primitives.
  * Common usages include visibility determination, lens flares / coronas rendering etc.
  *
  * Usage :
  * \code
  * IOcclusionQuery *oq = drv->createOcclusionQuery();
  * oq->begin();
  * // render some primitives... usually with color/z-buffer writes  disabled 
  * oq->end();
  *
  * switch(oq->getOcclusionType())
  * {
  *     case IOcclusionQuery::NotAvailable: 
  *       // Defer test. One should ideally wait the next frame.
  *       // Note that polling the result in a wait loop isn't safe, unless the driver is flushed.
  *		break;
  *     case IOcclusionQuery::Occluded:
  *       // no pixels passed the z-test
  *     break;
  *     case IOcclusionQuery::NotOccluded:
  *       // some pixels passed the z-test
  *     break;
  * };
  *
  * \endcode
  *
  * After one's finished with IOcclusionQuery, IDriver::deleteOcclusionQuerry should be called
  *
  * IMPORTANT : - Occlusion query objects are invalid after a driver has been deleted, and thus must be recreated when driver changes.  
  *             - Only one occlusion query object can be active at a time, e.g IOcclusionQuery::begin() should not be called
  *               within another begin() / end() pair. Such a situation will cause an assertion.
  *             - Not all drivers support the occlusion query mechanism. This should be checked by calling IDriver::supportOcclusionQuery.
  *               If not supported, the application can fallback to IDriver::getZBuffer, at the risk of stalling the GPU.
  *             - For a given query, result should NOT be retrieved between a begin()/end() pair, otherwise an assertion is raised
