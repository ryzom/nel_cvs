/**
 * The basic interface for shapes. A shape is a kind of instanciable mesh.
 * For simplicity, render() and clip() virtual method are provided, so majority of shape could be implemented by just
 * define those methods, and let createInstance() as default. But other complex shapes may be defined, by implement 
 * a compatible model which will comunicate with them.
 *
 * Serialisation of a shape MUST be done with ISTREAM::serialPolyPtr.
 *
 * \b DERIVER \b RULES:
 *		- simple: just implement clip() and render(). The shape will be movable via CTransform.
 *		- complex: if special interaction is needed between the instance and the shape:
 *			- implement a special Model, derived from CTransformShape, adding your instance behavior.
 *			- implement YourShape::createInstance(), so it create this good model.
 *			- implement your own communication system between the model and the shape.
