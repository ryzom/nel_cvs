/**
 * This track is supposed to be Lighter in memory than CTrackKeyFramerTCBVector, and also is maybe faster.
 *	The track is an oversampled version of CTrackKeyFramerTCBVector (or any vector interpolator), to 30 fps for example,
 *	but each key is 13 bytes in memory, instead of 96.
 *	Only linear interpolation is performed between 2 keys. And Keys are precomputed
 *
 *	13 bytes per key is achieved by encoding this way:
 *		1 byte for the length/key time, measured in samples, and not in second (hence we can skip at max 255 keys).
 *		12 byte for the position. May be compressed in future to 6 bytes.
